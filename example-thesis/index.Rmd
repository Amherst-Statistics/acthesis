<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT REMINDERS!!

(1) Before you knit the document, make sure to update your _bookdown.yml file with:
    - your knitted pdf name (book_filename: "FirstName-LastName_StatThesis")
    - your filenames in order (rmd_files: ["thisfilename.Rmd", "firstChapter.Rmd", ..., "99-references.Rmd"])

(2) You can rename any of the chapter files, including this index file, as long as you update the filenames in _bookdown.yml

(3) Knit this file to knit the entire thesis document, or knit within a single chapter file to only knit that chapter (all other chapters will be knit with just a placeholder sentence). You will likely run into issues when knitting a single chapter if that chapter depends on code from previous chapters.  

(4) No thesis code or text should go in this index file except that used to set up the remainder of the document.

<!--
The acthesis package does not need to be loaded for your thesis (but DOES need to be installed on your machine). It's loaded here as a quick way to load the packages needed to knit this example document. 

You can delete the following code chunk from your final document if you wish.
-->
```{r include_acthesis, include = FALSE}
# acthesis package loads dpylr, ggplot2, knitr, bookdown, and remotes
require(acthesis)
```


<!--
R has some built-in options that may be useful. Some recommended values are set below. Feel free to play around with the options You may edit or delete this code chunk if you wish.

- width: max width of R output (default: based on console width)
- digits: number of significant digits to print (default: 7)
-->
```{r set_options, include = FALSE}
# Default width of R ouput
options(width = 65, digits = 3)
```


<!--
This is a clunky workaround to wrap super long R output. This code chunk defines a new code chunk option called linewidth that allows you to wrap R output that falls into the margins or off the page.

The default linewidth for R output in the thesis template is 65, set with options(width = 65). If the linewidth option is still needed for a specific code chunk despite this setting, we recommend using linewidth = 65 for consistency.
-->
```{r wrap-hook, include = FALSE}
# Define a new code chunk option 'linewidth' for wrapping unruly R output
hook_output = knitr::knit_hooks$get('output')
knitr::knit_hooks$set(output = function(x, options) {
  # this hook is used only when the linewidth option is not NULL
  if (!is.null(n <- options$linewidth)) {
    x = knitr:::split_lines(x)
    # any lines wider than n should be wrapped
    if (any(nchar(x) > n)) x = strwrap(x, width = n, exdent = 3, indent = 3)
    x = paste(x, collapse = '\n')
  }
  hook_output(x, options)
})
# Note: set linewidth = 65 when needed.
```
