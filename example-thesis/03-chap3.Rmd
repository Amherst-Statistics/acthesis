## Math

\TeX\ is the best way to typeset mathematics. Donald Knuth designed \TeX\ when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics.  One nice feature of _R Markdown_ is its ability to read LaTeX code directly.

If you are doing a thesis that will involve lots of math, you will want to read the following section.



$$
\sum_{j=1}^n (\delta\theta_j)^2 \leq 
\frac{\beta_i^2}{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2}
\left[ 2\rho_i^2 + \frac{\delta_i^2\beta_i^2}{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2} \right] \equiv \omega_i^2
$$

From Informational Dynamics, we have the following (Dave Braden):

After _n_ such encounters the posterior density for $\theta$ is

$$
\pi(\theta|X_1< y_1,\dots,X_n<y_n) \varpropto \pi(\theta) \prod_{i=1}^n\int_{-\infty}^{y_i}
   \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\theta)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\ dx
$$

Another equation:

$$
\det\left|\,\begin{matrix}%
c_0&c_1\hfill&c_2\hfill&\ldots&c_n\hfill\cr
c_1&c_2\hfill&c_3\hfill&\ldots&c_{n+1}\hfill\cr
c_2&c_3\hfill&c_4\hfill&\ldots&c_{n+2}\hfill\cr
\,\vdots\hfill&\,\vdots\hfill&
  \,\vdots\hfill&&\,\vdots\hfill\cr
c_n&c_{n+1}\hfill&c_{n+2}\hfill&\ldots&c_{2n}\hfill\cr
\end{matrix}\right|>0
$$

## Statistics Symbols and Expressions

<!--
The \noindent command below does what you'd expect:  it forces the current line/paragraph to not indent. This was done here to match the format of the LaTeX thesis PDF.
-->

\noindent Exponent or Superscript: $x^2$

\noindent Subscript: $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$

\noindent Both combined: $x_1^{k+1}$.


\noindent Our favorite Greeks: $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, $\mu$

\noindent Defining a normally distributed random variable: $X\sim N(\mu, \sigma)$

How do we compute sample variance again?

$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^2}{n-1}$$

Sometimes  you'll need to consider asymptotics, that is, what happens as $n\rightarrow \infty$.



## Additional information

Many of the symbols you will need can be found on Reed College's math page <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/math.html> and the Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol Guide (<http://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf>).
